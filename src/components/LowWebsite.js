            <h4>What we provide:</h4>  
            <li>You are business owner, not a software person. We are well aware of this. We will take care of all details.</li>
            <li>By working with us, our clients will make two payments. One payment will be done at the beginning of the project.
              This will be between 150-300 Euros depending on image numbers and product numbers. If our client requests extra 
              website customization, this will be done with extra charge. This package includes everything, even a name for your website. </li>
            <li>Second payment is 25-50 Euros per month (We also have year plans with discount). This payment is needed because we do not 
              want to create website and leave our clients alone. We will continue to assist you as much as possible. Secondly, e-commerce 
              websites require special hosting with database support. We will use this monthly payment to pay for those services as well.
              In summary, your monthly payment will cover these special services fee + assistance from us. And we are saying 25-50 Euros because
              some websites require more database and hosting support. That's why this monthly price can be up to 50 Euros. Monthly 
              payment will start after 30 days we deploy your website. </li>
            <li>We will manage everything, including finding a name your website. You will only need to send us images 
              and product description</li>
            <li>We will not leave you alone. Our phones are open to you. The software engineer that will be assigned to 
              you will help you as much as possible. </li>
            <li>Our service is very ideal for especially small to medium businesses who would like to have their website. Finding a software
              person working for you is very expensive actually. Something around 2000-3000 euros per month depending on the country.
              As you can see, our service is much cheaper than this. We are also providing a better service compare to Wordpress and Shopify.
              You might think that those companies are better but check their website please. You'll see how complicated and expensive they are.
            </li>
            <li>You decided to work with us? Next step is easy, just send us a whatsapp message. We will make this process smooth and easy.</li>
